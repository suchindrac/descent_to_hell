# descent_to_hell

Before I go further, this is entirely my understanding, and I am not at a point to argue with others regarding this

The below two scripts show the descent of Souls to hell. In the original version of the design of this universe, the animal simulation was the learning place, where the person could be the badass he wanted to be and learn in the real world. However, later, things changed. The Souls (or rather minds and subconscious minds) of the ones who had arrived earlier into the animal world, grouped into various groups. These 'entities' now started working towards 'unconsciously' pushing the people down the ladder of freedom, so that the people ended up with very less energy, thereby becoming one among the people pushing them. The journey toward growth and freedom then becomes  more difficult and painful

Each oval is a Soul. Green-colored souls have higher energy. Red-colored souls have lesser energy. The more red a Soul is, the lesser the energy. The region from the top till 200 units below the top, is considered as the real world simulation (human simulation). The region below that is considered as the animal simulation. People in the animal simulation either move towards the real world for "paying back", or move downwards till they exhaust all their energy, and again go to the real world to "pay back". In the second case, the activity happens because of the 'entities' that influence these people

Carefully guarding oneself against these 'entities' is an art that can only be exercised by Souls who have been to hell multiple times

It is my own experience that guided me towards writing this article and writing these scripts. I remembered my own past lives and understood what had gone wrong

I have to incorporate now the part played by some of the major players in this universe, to show how they manifest the most important aspect in the universe, namely "freedom", in various animal world simulations to make people learn by looking at them. The original design of the universe had the concept of animal world simulations, only as places used for making people to learn through experience. That will be the future of the universe again. We are in the midst of this major change across the universe
